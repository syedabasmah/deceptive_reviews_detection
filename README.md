# deceptive_reviews_detection

I have uploaded my machine learning project in this repository.
It is called "Deceptive Reviews Detection using Machine Learning Models".
There are four settings for this project to get the best possible results. 
The ott. dataset is also uploaded here which can also be downloaded from kaggle.
Thank you!
